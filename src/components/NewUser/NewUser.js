        <p>MOOD TRACKER is a place of honesty and non-judgement. This is for your own personal growth, 
          so no masks are needed here. Take a minute or two to close your eyes, breathe deep, and re-live 
          a comforting memory - maybe a big hug, a cozy evening by the fireplace, or a time your ideas were 
          supported. The choice is yours. After taking a moment to ground yourself you're ready to begin.
        </p>
        <p>
          MOOD TRACKER helps you track various aspects of your life - Mood, Food, Movement, Sleep, and Therapy. 
          Each of these, with the exception of Mood, can be turned on or off at your discretion. Tracking things 
          like these can be quite beneficial to the health (both physical and mental) of some people. You may 
          also add a short journal entry each day if you would like.
        </p>

          Building new habits can be difficult, and replacing old habits that are no longer serving you can be 
          an even bigger challenge. However, patterns can emerge when things like mood or sleep are tracked. 
          Seeing and acknowledging these patterns can be the first step on the path towards being the version 
          of yourself that you want to be. Your future self with thank you.
